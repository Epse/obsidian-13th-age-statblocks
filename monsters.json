Anyone who uses a coup de grace on the devil before its next turn will slay it before it can claim a chunk of a soul and escape (but the PCs might not be aware of this).</p>\n<p><strong>Effects:</strong> What does it mean to have a chunk of your soul stolen.

Use one or more, as you choose.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Magic items no longer work for the affected character, even ones already attuned to them, and in a similar vein, no new items can be attuned by that PC.</li>\n<li>The PC loses access to their highest level of spells or powers. For example, a cleric who normally casts 7th level spells could only cast them at 5th level.</li>\n<li>The PC takes a &ndash;2 penalty to saves.</li>\n<li>The PC must roll 2d20 for attack rolls and take the lowest result for the first two rounds of each battle.</li>\n<li>The PC&rsquo;s appearance changes in some disturbing, hollow way and they take a &ndash;4 penalty to skill checks.</li>\n<li>PC loses one to three recoveries; not temporarily, their ability to heal decreases.</li>\n<li>One icon relationship changes to become a sign of complications with devils, not advantages.</li>\n<li>Devils gets some huge combat advantage against the PC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Restoration:</strong> Similarly, you can choose how the missing piece of soul might be restored. Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No big deal: the PC rolls a normal save each time they gain a level. If the save succeeds, they get their soul back.</li>\n<li>The party must find and kill the escaped hubris devil. Luckily, the PC&rsquo;s &lsquo;link&rsquo; to the devil means that each day the PC can roll a normal save; on an 11+, they have a good idea of which direction the devil is in. And hubris devils don&rsquo;t move all that much.</li>\n<li>Instead, the party must travel to the center of the devils&rsquo; power and steal back their friend&rsquo;s soul shard. Or whatever it is that you think their particular soul piece is gonna look like.</li>\n<li>The devils immediately barter the soul shard to an enemy icon, leading to an entirely new set of quests and complications.</li>\n</ul>"

Anyone who uses a coup de grace on the devil before its next turn will slay it before it can claim a chunk of a soul and escape (but the PCs might not be aware of this).</p>\n<p><strong>Effects:</strong> What does it mean to have a chunk of your soul stolen. You&rsquo;re free to come up with complications that suit your campaign&rsquo;s metaphysics or take the suggestions that follow as a starting point. Use one or more, as you choose.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Magic items no longer work for the affected character, even ones already attuned to them, and in a similar vein, no new items can be attuned by that PC.</li>\n<li>The PC loses access to their highest level of spells or powers. For example, a cleric who normally casts 7th level spells could only cast them at 5th level.</li>\n<li>The PC takes a &ndash;2 penalty to saves.</li>\n<li>The PC must roll 2d20 for attack rolls and take the lowest result for the first two rounds of each battle.</li>\n<li>The PC&rsquo;s appearance changes in some disturbing, hollow way and they take a &ndash;4 penalty to skill checks.</li>\n<li>PC loses one to three recoveries; not temporarily, their ability to heal decreases.</li>\n<li>One icon relationship changes to become a sign of complications with devils, not advantages.</li>\n<li>Devils gets some huge combat advantage against the PC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Restoration:</strong> Similarly, you can choose how the missing piece of soul might be restored. Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No big deal: the PC rolls a normal save each time they gain a level. If the save succeeds, they get their soul back.</li>\n<li>The party must find and kill the escaped hubris devil. Luckily, the PC&rsquo;s &lsquo;link&rsquo; to the devil means that each day the PC can roll a normal save; on an 11+, they have a good idea of which direction the devil is in. And hubris devils don&rsquo;t move all that much.</li>\n<li>Instead, the party must travel to the center of the devils&rsquo; power and steal back their friend&rsquo;s soul shard. Or whatever it is that you think their particular soul piece is gonna look like.</li>\n<li>The devils immediately barter the soul shard to an enemy icon, leading to an entirely new set of quests and complications.</li>\n</ul>"

Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No big deal: the PC rolls a normal save each time they gain a level. If the save succeeds, they get their soul back.</li>\n<li>The party must find and kill the escaped hubris devil. Luckily, the PC&rsquo;s &lsquo;link&rsquo; to the devil means that each day the PC can roll a normal save; on an 11+, they have a good idea of which direction the devil is in. And hubris devils don&rsquo;t move all that much.</li>\n<li>Instead, the party must travel to the center of the devils&rsquo; power and steal back their friend&rsquo;s soul shard.
